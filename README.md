# IOT-Samples
This repo has a sample Smart Contract which enables IOT devices to log transactions on the blockchain. This allows you to trace back the logs to the devices.
These transactions can be anything, from a camera recording the frames per second, to a coffee machine recording the number of lattes being served.

PLEASE NOTE that this is not production ready in any way, and serves as a sample for demo purposes.
