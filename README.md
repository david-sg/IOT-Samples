# IOT-Samples
This repo has a sample Smart Contract which shows how IOT devices can log transactions on the blockchain and trace back all of these.
These transactions can be anything,ranging right from a camera recording the frames per second, to a coffee machine recording the number of lattes being served.

PLEASE NOTE that this is not production ready in any way, and serves as a sample for demo purposes.
